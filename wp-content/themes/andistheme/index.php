      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a Hungarian filmmaker from Subotica (Serbia). I attended the University of East London's Media, Film and Culture Studies course and received a BA honours degree in Media and Creative Industries in 2008. </p>
      
      <p>In 2010, I joined the London Film School (LFS) where I directed three fiction short films, one of which - Kyoto Rain - was screened at Palm Beach and Arizona Film Festivals in 2013. I also produced a few other shorts including a documentary for which I was co-director as well.</p>
      
      <p>In October 2014, I completed my graduation film at LFS titled A Lovely Life, and have written a treatment for a feature film based on my graduation short. 
I have been working as a filmmaker since 2009 starting as Producerâ€™s Assistant and later as Head of Development.</p>

      <p>Since graduating from LFS I have been working as a freelance video editor and videographer commissioned to record and edit event videos and promotional films by estate agency, charity and other independent commissioners. Altogether I participated in the making of more than 20 short fiction films, corporate videos and documentaries.</p>
